# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Activity Bar icon is now a paw print (clearer at small sizes than the pug head)
- Pull requests: **Start New Task** makes a branch from the latest main (uncommitted work comes along);
  **Send for Review** pushes it and opens the pull request on GitHub (or sends new commits to the open one).
  Commits made on main by mistake are moved to a task branch, and main is put back in line with the remote.
  PushPug tells you when your pull request is merged (**Back to main**: switch, pull, delete the finished branch),
  closed, or conflicts with main (**Get the latest main**), and when a teammate opens one. A card in My Team shows
  the task and its pull request. A push refused by branch protection / rulesets is explained, with
  **Send for review instead**. Settings `pullRequests.enabled`, `pullRequests.notifyTeam`
- Renamed to PushPug (was PushPal); the mascot is now called Pug. The old background job is removed on first run;
  settings saved under `pushpal.*` need to be set again
- GitHub checks: after your pushes and your teammates', PushPug follows the commit's check runs and statuses
  and tells you how it went ("✅ All checks passed (4/4)" / "❌ Checks failed: 1 of 4 — Test (ubuntu-latest)").
  A teammate's failing push says "maybe don't pull it yet" (See what broke / Pull anyway / Later); you're told
  when it's fixed. Status bar ✓ / ✗ / ⏳; a badge on every commit in My Team that opens the list of checks,
  and for a failing GitHub Actions job the failed step, the last 30 log lines and a plain-language hint.
  Uses VS Code's GitHub sign-in (asked once); background alerts include checks when the `gh` CLI is signed in.
  New wizard step and settings (`actions.notifyOnPass`, `actions.notifyFor`)
- Push (check first): fetches before pushing and offers "Merge, then push for me"; rejected pushes from VS Code's
  own Push / Sync are explained with the same offer
- Undo the last merge for 10 minutes, uncommitted work included (refuses, with a reason, after new commits or edits)
- Git errors explained in plain language with the fix, plus "Show full message"
- Do-not-disturb hours and "Mute 1 hour" (status bar keeps updating; missed alerts come afterwards)
- README rewritten (English) with install steps for macOS and Windows and a how-to section
- My Team timeline shows commit authors' GitHub profile pictures (initials when there's none); setting `pushpug.avatars`
- New mascot: Pal is a flat-style pug head whose expressions follow what's going on — asleep when you're up
  to date, sniffing while checking, startled and barking when a teammate pushes, tugging a two-colour rope
  while merging, jump-spinning on success, puzzled at conflicts, teary when GitHub Actions fail, winking when
  they pass, wiggling when you poke it (heart eyes after a few pokes). Random idle life (blinks, ear twitches, glances, little smiles).
  Animated with GSAP; respects reduced motion
- New extension icon and Activity Bar icon (pug head)
- Check frequency modes: ⚡ Fastest (10 s), ⚖️ Balanced (30 s, new default), 🔋 Battery saver (60 s) and 🛠 Custom,
  in the setup wizard (new step) and the settings page, each with checks/hour and data/hour estimates from measured fetch sizes
- Automatic battery saving: idle, low battery (not plugged in), Low Power Mode / Battery Saver, plugged in = normal;
  the status bar tooltip explains when and why checks are slower
- Checking hours (e.g. 08:00–23:00), honoured by the background job too
- Separate background interval (60–3600 s); the background job re-reads its settings on every run
- GitHub Actions watcher: status bar progress while tests run, a message when they pass or fail
- New “PushPug Settings” page (Notifications / Frequency & battery / Language & theme / GitHub), live two-way sync with
  VS Code Settings, Restore defaults; new command “PushPug: Switch Check Mode”
- Values outside their range are pulled back in and you're told what changed
- `pushpug.checkIntervalSeconds` now allows 10–300 s (default 30). An explicit value from 1.0.0 is kept and the mode becomes Custom
- New mascot: Pal is now a round face whose brows, eyes, mouth and cheeks change with the state
- Poke Pal: it squishes, bounces and giggles, and gets dizzy if you poke too fast
- Activity bar icon matches the new face
- Releases: `npm run release` bumps the version and pushes a tag; CI publishes to the Marketplace and Open VSX
- Fix: background-worker test no longer expects launchctl/schtasks on Linux
